# MyStore-ECommerce
In this project, I worked on Selenium Data Driven Framework(It's cloned project). I wrote test cases for an e-commerce website, covering different actions on pages like index page, home page, payment page, login page, order page, and payment page. I used a PageObject Model and created proper packages for the config file, Excel files, and utility files.
